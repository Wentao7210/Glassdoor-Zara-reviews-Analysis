Experience at Zara
28 Jan 2023 - Sales Assistant 
Recommend
CEO Approval
Business Outlook
Pros
- I was able to broaden my skills whilst working at ZARA as I was able to, not only communicate with employees, but I was also able to make customers feel comfortable and satisfied by the end of the conversation. Due to the communication skills I had, I was able to satisfy and fulfil the needs and wants of customers, meeting their requirements. - Furthermore, I was also able to sell high-end goods to customers as they'd ask for my opinion and help before purchasing a product from the store. - I was able to work with employees in a group to ensure that customers within the store remained satisfied and happy with the services provided. - I was also able to learn how to work under pressure which was entirely beneficial as, working in Oxford Street, it meant that whatever time it was, the store would be very busy. Therefore, after adapting to the workplace and being able to understand how everything works, I got the hang of it and would say that I definitely increased customer satisfaction rate.
Cons
I feel that there were a handful of employees that felt satisfied. The store was very diverse, however, although it looked diverse, there was a clear segregation within the store, meaning it was uncomfortable to work at times. Therefore, I felt the store was not worth staying at. I also believe that the pay was not enough for the job that we had to do, but that's not an issue anymore as there was a pay rise to £12 an hour.

Pros
Literally just the pay was okay!
Cons
The managers? Horrible. Staff? Horrible (with a legit exception of like 3 people that were nice). Customers? Horrible. Literally nothing good about working here😂 the store manager is the worst person I’ve come across in my life and I still don’t know how she holds the position of a STORE manager when she’s that incompetent in managing and speaking to people as humans and not ROBOTS and DOGS. Floor managers also hideous. Giving me overtime without asking me and then acting like they changed it on the rota and it’s my fault that I hadn’t seen it when in reality there had been no changes. Simply manipulating and gaslighting you. Working conditions were absolutely horrible, so hot and we have to run up and down all the time obeying to 10 different managers because they don’t communicate with each other. I quit after 3-4 weeks and so did many of the people that started same time with me!

character building. I you can work here you can work anywhere.

Force their staff to work hours of overtime without paying them for it. when asking for the pay they 'lose the the signet sheet' speak to staff like they are worthless. constant criticism from about management as it's such a poorly organised and low performing store. managers will blame staff but in reality all of the managers sit in the back stairs watching re runs of love island and send sales assistants out to the shop for them whilst they do absolutely nothing. If they are called out for their behaviour they will bully you and make a very real attempt of constructive dismissal. I have never known management to have so many complaints from staff members for bullying as well as law suits.

management is terrible sometimes when i first started working with the company i loved it since i had good managers, then all the good managers left and new ones came. The new managers often had power trips where they spoke to staff rudely and never showed any respect but expected it back. I would definitely say the workplace depends on the management. Also with some managers they won't talk to you unless you speak spanish which is quite rude.
