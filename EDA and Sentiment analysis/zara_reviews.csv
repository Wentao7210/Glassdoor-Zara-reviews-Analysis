3,Former Employee,Experience at Zara,28-Jan-23, Sales Assistant ,None," I was able to broaden my skills whilst working at ZARA as I was able to, not only communicate with employees, but I was also able to make customers feel comfortable and satisfied by the end of the conversation. Due to the communication skills I had, I was able to satisfy and fulfil the needs and wants of customers, meeting their requirements.  Furthermore, I was also able to sell highend goods to customers as they'd ask for my opinion and help before purchasing a product from the store.  I was able to work with employees in a group to ensure that customers within the store remained satisfied and happy with the services provided.  I was also able to learn how to work under pressure which was entirely beneficial as, working in Oxford Street, it meant that whatever time it was, the store would be very busy. Therefore, after adapting to the workplace and being able to understand how everything works, I got the hang of it and would say that I definitely increased customer satisfaction rate.","I feel that there were a handful of employees that felt satisfied. The store was very diverse, however, although it looked diverse, there was a clear segregation within the store, meaning it was uncomfortable to work at times. Therefore, I felt the store was not worth staying at. I also believe that the pay was not enough for the job that we had to do, but that's not an issue anymore as there was a pay rise to £12 an hour."

Discriminatory  if I went on you would be shocked to hear the rest. Always understaffed Sometimes you won't get a breakbecause its so busy and you can't leave the shopfloor unattended. Ladies wear employees are always jealous of menswear employees and take their anger out on them  because menswear is supposedly ""never busy"". Claim that you don't even do that much and that you ""have it easy because your in menswear"" even though you've been sweating running back and forth from the stockroom to the shopfloor all day because your a nice person and actually want to help customers. Employees complaining about their job all the time and making new employees feel uncomfortableunwelcome. If you don't like your job, no one forced you to stay don't make others feel uncomfortable. Everyone is so moody because everyone is overworked. Even though its a tough job, it's not that bad if you have nice coworkers."

Fresh fruit basket every day, discount for gym membership. There is RFID system integrated which allows replenishement to be done in very effective way. Posibility to grow in the company if you have people focused manager. All zara experience depends on the management. If manager is able to keep stress inside for staff not to notice it, you will have a nice experience.","It's really fast paces environment. Even if you want to learn and train other people to grow, you don't always have time for that, as hours in all the stores are being cut, productivity increased and you are being pushed to the limits. And its not only in the stores that hours are cut off, but also in head office. Everyone is just tired and its sad, as the way company works in some aspects is amazing. Sometimes you work in your store, and are used to it, and then regional HR will come and tell you that you will be working in other store from next week. Head office has plan for all their managers to move between stores 2 times in a year. Work/life balance is not very good, as your rota can change a lot due to bussiness needs.

Sometimes you are lucky enought to work with a good team. Possibility to grow really fast inside the company. Good starting point for people without a working experience. Good commissions.","Do not expect to receive any appreciation for the job done: even if you do your best, will always be some criticism from the management staff. The employ discount is ridiculous, 15% off. Most of the management is arrogant and unable to manage and motivate the team. The reason why is linked to the possibility to grow really fast inside the company (in less than two years you can go from basic sales assistant to department manager): the trainings are not long enought to get a proper knowledge/experience about managing people. Unable to motivate and retain people. The figure of the employ is seen as a sort of machine: there is no possibility to express personal opinions, you have just to get your job done how and when they ""order"" you. The power is too much centralised: avery single indication comes from Spain. They pretend to apply the same marketing mix, health & safety rules, ... in the same way everywhere without keeping into account that every single store has specific features and needs."

No social life on 40hour contract with the late hours and two days of the week off rarely being on the weekend or consecutive. People are promoted based on favoritism, not performance, education or experience. Everyone including managers speak their native language, not English as it states in the handbook and no one is ever told not to or disciplined so there is no employee harmony. Have to stay an hour and a half after closing just to tidy up so you can imagine how messy it gets, not allowed to leave if the standards aren't finished regardless of how busy it's been. The overall culture of the workplace is awful, you cannot trust anyone. I read the reviews of Zara on the day I got the job and didn't think it could be bad as people said but it truly is."

Opportunities to transfer and work in different countries in Europe if you speak the language. Great 25% staff discount. Commission with each pay cheuqe depending on the performance of the store  1% for sales staff and 2% for cashiers. Relatively flat structure so most staff are in the same boat with regards to responsibility, expectations, etc which creates a sense of togetherness. Most stores have a dedicated stock room team. Handheld devices which (in theory) allow for easy stock check. Consistent managerial style. Stores renovated every few years. Great location.",Can be incredibly busy at times with very little change in staffing levels to reflect this. Stores seem to be constantly understaffed which can make completing even the simplest of tasks seem overwhelming. Unwillingness to open another till/cash desk at peak times puts cashiers under massive pressure and results in huge queues and unhappy customers to deal with. Equipment has a tendency to break or die when you most need it. Complicated pay structure (although this is common across the industry). Working at Zara involves a remarkable amount of cleaning  once the store has closed you are expected to stay behind for around one hour to tidy the store. No real scope for promotion but in reality only a select few will want to progress their career at Zara.

Little appreciation from managers. They seem to care more about sale targets and the latest clothing items of the week. Rotas are chopped and changed even the day before  without anyone giving you notice. You are expected just to be aware of your change in shifts Extremely inflexible and draining. Often you will get given shifts that don't match with your availability. I wouldn't recommend this job for a fulltime student. Before you know it, it will take over your life and you WILL feel unhappy. i.e. your contract will be minimum 16 hours a week, but you will be given 20+ hours a week. Don't even think about booking time off/Christmas off without a resistance from managers Don't expect to finish on time. You will be expected to finished 13 hours over your shift. No negotiation. No prior notification. Due to working extra hours on a shift you will not have the appropriate breaks due to you = slave labour At least 34 people quit every week since store opening. Self explanatory. The store will continue to have a highturnover because working conditions are terrible. Most people carry on at the store for the money besides that, staff clearly don't enjoy being there."

Depending on the store you are walking on eggshells the whole time you're there. You start at say 12.30. You have to be on the floor for 12.20. If you're one minute late they mark you down as late and tell you off.  But they will keep you up to an hour after your shift has ended, a lot of the time unpaid. There's always favourites who get treated better. A lot of the managers are on a power trip. Bad atmosphere that's always tense. They change the rota without asking up the day before your shift or day off. They expect you to beable to do it and know anyway. One rule for managers, one rule for everyone else. Everyone who has started in their first week wanted to leave straightaway, only some stuck it out. They snap if you do one thing wrong. A lot of people end up in tears. If you do stick it out you'll grow a very thick skin, but you'll still hate it. The long term staff most have been there a year or 2. Most people leave after a few months. They will heap lots of extra responsibility on your shoulders with no extra pay or title, when one thing goes wrong not in your control they will tell you off or call a meeting. Even though it isn't in your contract as your responsibility. The managers will slack off and pass as many jobs onto you as they can."

The staff and interviewers at INDITEX were friendly and polite.,"The following review is my personal experience and what my colleagues experienced at a particular central store. Managers treat you as if you are dumb and a slave. Two of our managers were multiple times aggressive, throwing clothes and hangers on the employees, staff was constantly left in tears. When I informed them that my contract has ended and I do not wish to continue working there (they would continue to put me on the rota), two of the three store managers tried to keep me tied to my contract by putting my signature on an extended contract that I never signed! Whilst I insisted that this is illegal and I do not wish to come back, one of them yelled at me ""Do you think you will find any better? I'll put you on the black list and you'll never get a job, stupid sales assistants think they are smart but that's the job you'll do for life!"" in her broken ItalianEnglish. I've never met more arrogant and mean people in a workplace. I felt threatened and left their office without saying anything. I was too excited as I was starting my Master degree, I did not have time to deal with negativity, arrogance and uneducated people but I wish I'd have reported these particular staff members. I love Zara stores but not how their employees are treated. I hope things have changed since then and everyone is safe."

You often have to deal with rude customers. Some managers are great, but most of them are rude, unpleasant people to work with. They show off their 'power' treating sales assistant in a bad way so if you don't stand up for yourself you may get bullied easily. Managers and sales assistant speak Spanish all the time, so if you're not Spanish good luck, Spanish are also preferred when it comes to career progression. You won't have a work/life balance as with 30 hours I was already feeling like I was spending my whole life there. Shift patterns are bad : 5 days a week 6hours a day for 30 hours contract and 5 days a week 4 hours a day for 20 hours contract which is just ridiculous.

Management would often pit employees against each other and spread 'she said, he said' rumours as apparently we'd work better when we're not on friendly terms. Rota would be changed and no warning would be given. I was working night shifts and pay is double. I was changed to day shifts with no word and no reason.

Discount was good (went up to 20%)"," Despite being fun to work with, 70% of my colleagues were either Spanish or Italian which made it very difficult when they spoke in their native languages, which they did all the time unless there's a manager on the shop floor.  The ""commission"" is rubbish, it's something like 1% of the daily sales divided by every colleague that worked that day (calculating how long they worked that day). Keep in mind there was well over 40 employees in the female section  Not enough employees. Meant to have 46 sales assistants on the shop floor, depending on the time, period of sales, etc..., but most of the times there were 3 sales assistants.

The management made me solely responsible for the theft that occurred in the fitting rooms, and often called me to the office to shout at me about it in front of other members of staff who shared the office. Also, I'd literally be forced to stay for longer than my shift required. I remember on my first day I was walking off to leave at 8PM, when my shift was supposed to finish, and my managers made me stay until 10PM. It was like that for every 'closing' shift I worked from then on. Not to mention one time a superheavy clothing rack fell on my foot and when I told another member of staff what had happened she yelled at me about how I was late to carry the clothes rack back down, even through my foot was throbbing and I was limping. :) Honestly only I worked there for one Summer three years ago but thinking about my time there still aggrevates me to the core :) Do not work there if you want to maintain your sanity."

When your at the tills your working as hard as a machine to get your job done. Most stores are really understaffed and they need to hire more staff as the stores can get really busy. Black Friday, Boxing Day and the summer sales are the worst. You need work your socks off and you get little breaks. Long hours are a major issue and you need to do overtime and tidy up the store after the customers leave a huge mess on sale days. Benifits package could be improved as well."

Always short staffed so everyone has to work 100x harder than they should with no recognition of their efforts from management. Consistently made to work after hours without being paid, and expected to start work 15 mins early and not be paid for it. If you leave, the company withholds your wages for 10 days after payday so they can 'adjust everything'. As if the staff aren't rude enough the customers are even worse, long days of customers screaming and shouting at you for things out of your control. Your bag is searched every time you enter and leave the store, and your locker checked regularly as the company doesn't trust their staff not to steal from them. Management are racist and assume that anybody who enters the store who isn't white and middle class is a thief. You are told to not discuss HR issues such as sickness and holiday on social media, but it's perfectly acceptable for management to contact you about shift changes and other HR issues via social media."

No structure. I worked in several different stores and never received even basic Health and Safety training! Managers have favourites and get away with speaking to other staff like they are something they've stepped in. Expectations are far too high, managers are expected to work 50  60 hours a week and more for no extra pay or even a thank you.

I had never been in this situation before so I did not know that is was acceptable to leave my till in this way.

The company does not care for their employees who are often working in very bad conditions, where cold temperatures were sometimes unbearable and the staff was not allowed to wear jumpers. Managers are very uneducated and do not receive any managerial training. Most of the time, they are young people without any education, who worked there since they were 16 and would not be able to retain in any other job. They then missuse their power and put the rest of the staff down. Some of the managers' comments affected not only me but also my other collegues. Managers aim to manipulate the staff by making them feel that they would not be able to find a better job, so people end up working there for years, loosing their confidence."

Of course the staff was then absolutely exhausted and super stressed (the productivity in my department was 175%)  Even the employee discount is really low (25%), when you know that most competitors are offering 50% off They simply do not care about their staff, if you want a balance between your work and personal life, you should avoid working in this company!!

It is a excellent place to get experience in retail and learn the internal operations of such a big company. After working one year in Zara, every job interview that I had in retail was successful because they are aware of the hard work that means working there. There are opportunities to get internal promotions to become merchandiser, mentor or deputy manager, although these opportunities are not equal to all members of the staff and they are subject to the favouritism of the shop and line managers. The shops are so busy that the time flies. The company pays the employees every extra time that they do. 15% discount for staff in every shop from INDITEX (Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Zara home, Stradivarious, etc), even when the items are already on sale. Monthly commission based on the monthly profit of the entire shop where you work, depending on the numbers of hours that you work. In busy times like Christmas, this is a considerable increase to the salary.","The shifts can become quite tiring, especially at closing times: You know at what time you start but you will never know at what time you finish, as the staff cannot leave the shop until it is perfectly presentable for the next day. The rota are available with very little time in advance, so arranging plans for your personal life is almost impossible. Furthermore, this shifts can easily change from one day to another and you have to cope with it, no matter what your plans were.

They hire a LOT of people who dont speak or understand English properly  Everything it's easier if you're Spanish  There's people doing training to be merchandisers without doing the assessment  They renew every single contract even if you're not good at the job  They think you have no life and you always need to be available for them otherwise they will be upset and think you dont want to work  Rotas are only available about a week before the new month and they change EVERY single day  You request holiday or days off months earlier and they never get back to you, so they end up forgetting or just giving you the holidays they want, unless you ask them everyday  You have to stand up all day long and if you're on the shopfloor you can hardly go to your locker and get water (you're not allowed to bring water to wherever youre working) cos everyone's gonna be looking for you  same about going to the toilet  Retarded process of sign in in and out  you have to sign the hours you work and your signature on a paper they provide everyday  if you forget you need to speak with a manager and you get a file note straight away  Every week you need to check the ""weekly commission"" a paper that shows how many hours you worked the previous week and you better make sure it matches the actually hours you worked because sometimes they ""make mistakes"" or ""forget"" and that's basically like if you havent worked, so you're not getting paid  managers dont get paid for extra hours  Everyone's position is ""sales assistant"" even if you're a cashier or work in the stockroom  Cashiers used to have double comission  not sure if some still do  Everyone in the store earns the same money, apart from managers  Mentors, Supervisors and Responsible all earn the same as Sales Assistant, even though they have way more responsibilities  You can ask for transfer to any other brand or branch but no one will give it to you if you're good at your job"
2,"Current Employee, less than 1 year",Inconsistent and contradictory,08-Sep-15, Sales Associate/Cashier,"London, England",Customers are generally ok to serve. (A few odd ones if you're fast enough at the cash desk though),"Inconsistency  Zara change the rota everyday for Cashiers. You are told to check it everyday. So if you have other commitments, dont expect to fulfill them unless you have a good reason. They change the rota without telling you so if you dont turn up, you're in trouble. (Buy a Magic 8 Ball!) I've signed for a 20hour contract. In my first week i've done 5 out of 7 days already and a total of 34 hours. so clearly not parttime at all, or taking into account my needs (exams and studying). when shown how to do something ONCE (i.e. cashing up, following other procedures) i'm told that i must know how to do it myself the next time. very unrealistic and unreasonable. Also told by my Head Cashier that 3 mistakes = a disciplinary. (i tried to explain that i dont have an eidetic memory or that i'm not a robot but that was disregarded). standing for hours on shop floor behind cash desk and serving customers = tiring for your feet. shifts will begin i.e. 128pm, but then you are expected to stay 1 hour behind and ensure all is ok for cashing up the till. if not, you cant go home. it must be sorted out. you help with cashing up or shop floor folding. shift pattern is also sneaky that way too. you do say 5 hours = no break entitlement. but then stay an extra hour so by law you are allowed a 20min break for doing 6 hours but you dont get one, you work the 6 hours straight. other colleagues tell you how to do things, so some actually contradict themselves. others then complain and say that you're liable for mistakes. so expect to be confused. dont like how the rota can change as and when they please, yet when you ask them they say that they cant change it at all and that they need 1 months notice or before the next months rota is done. you can arrive at work, they dont even say hello and then ask you to stay to close. i dont like this inconsistency, contradictory stance and treated with disdain. you're not meant to speak spanish on shop floor at all yet many do. some staff are polite. others are just rude/ignorant. dont believe I will be staying here for much longer. i dont need the stress and i dont care about the staff discount either. my sanity and health are more important than clothes. this is hardcore retail... like working for the 'MI:5' leading clothing retailer where everything is meant to be perfect the first time round and you are to be a 'yes man'. your life will be zara, zara and zara. nothing else."
5,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Friendliest place I have ever worked at.,09-Nov-18, Cashier/Sales Assistant,"Kingston upon Thames, England"," Staff felt like family, it's the only company I've worked for in 10 years of retail that I would happily return to.  Decent perks  Fast paced and never boring  They actively train you if you want it  If you like fashion it's an amazing place to work  An alright commission depending on how many hours you work  Free fruit!"," At peak times (black friday, sales, christmas) it can be very stressful but everyone is in the same boat so it's not too bad.  Occasionally some friction/miscommunication between the stockroom staff and the sales floor staff."
3,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",Not for the weak or lazy!!!,07-Jul-17, Sales Associate/Cashier,"London, England","A mostly enjoyable experience due to my funny and friendly cashier employees who would help me in my times of need with troublesome customers. Another pro was the 25% employee discount that you can use in not only Zara but Bershka, Pull and Bear etc! This is especially good during the sales! You also receive a £50 gift voucher at Christmas, lots of fruit everyday and a decent retail salary compared to other shops due to the commission which if you're in a busy shop adds up every month! Working in Zara definitely teaches you how to work in a fast pace environment and improves your people skills and attention to detail. As someone who has worked on the tills, the shop floor and the fitting room, I can hand on heart say that being on the tills is definitely the best and easiest, except for the fact that you have lots of responsibility  so if money if missing in your department they will be harsh on everyone who was on the tills that day!","There are lots of cons with working in Zara, one would be the managers (NOT ALL) who can be very condescending and belittle you. As most of their first language are not English, they sometimes can be rude to the customer and not understand what they say meaning the customers sometimes get angry with you. The head cashiers can be very rude to you and you just have to take it! As someone who has worked in 3 different Zara stores I can tell you that some store managers are honestly the rudest people you will ever come across. On my first day at one store I vowed not to finish my week there due to the manager clapping in my face and being condescending to me as if I was a small child being told off by a teacher. They just don't listen to what you have to say! Some employees take advantage of you being new aswell. Another major con is the lack of store equipment like iPods which you need to check items for customers. Then the managers get angry at you for not being able to help the customer and expect you to find a nonexistent iPod out of thin air to help the customer quickly. As a store that makes so much money I have to say the technology in the store is rubbish! Old and slow so prepare for customers to get angry with you when its not your fault! Also working in Women's is the worst, if you can choose work in Men's as the customers are the nicest and don't give you as much attitude as the women customers. The environment in Men's (tills) is much more relaxed too as the head cashiers are all in ladies. In women's the workload is soo much more and if you're on the shop floor or fitting room it can become impossible to do everything the managers expect you to do (you have to be nonstop). The last major con I experienced is the fact that the managers just expect you to do overtime without the decency to ask if thats okay, especially when you are working the closing shift. So if I was finished at 11, overtime would mean that I would get home very late which is scary to travel that late from central London."

If your going to work in retail find a good store with a balanced workload  this is not life. On a part time 20 hour contract can still be working 5 days a week.

As she was offering me the job on the phone a couple of hours later, she asked if I could work days I told her I couldn't. It being Christmas, I said it was fine for now. I attended an induction that same week and when they gave me my timetable, she'd put me in for shifts that week even though she told me I could start the following week. When I asked the manager who gave me the schedule, she just shrugged in a 'take it or leave it' gesture. I ended up missing the last week of school because I really needed the money. There was a time when someone changed my four hour shift to a six hour and didn't bother to contact me. I ended up being two hours late and while no one had a go at me for it because it wasn't my fault, that was still more money that I could've made if I'd known about it. The job itself is pretty physically demanding, there's a lot of cleaning and tidying which involves a lot of bending and running around. This part of the job didn't bother me, it's basic retail work but it's a lot more intense than other places I've worked for and they take their policies and everything really seriously. If you're on the closing shift, you are guaranteed to stay at least 15 minutes after your shift, picking up the slack of the day workers. Someone told me you get paid for overtime only if you stay longer than 30 minutes but someone else told me its 15 minutes  which makes it harder to calculate how much you'll be paid. The Zara I worked at didn't have an electronic clockingin system so this was something I worried about. They don't ask people to stay later, they just expect it. My very first shift, people were telling me 'if you get a bus, speak to soandso and they might let you leave early'  even though my shift has already finished. Why do I need to argue with someone that I should leave on time? They don't make people stay later if their shift ends at 5pm. This is even worse if you're working behind the cash desk, don't expect to leave until really late because they calculate everything they've made at the end of the day. As this was Christmas time, the store was shutting at 11pm, meaning a closing shift lasts until 12am and I was always so anxious about catching the last bus. I found out that they weren't keeping me on when I saw the next month's rota (they didn't bother telling me) and I just quit."

Work environment isn't good employees are unhappy, health and safety regulations are only really applied on the shopfloor where others can see (in the back/staff area/stockroom it's chaos) High staff turn over (people quitting left, right and centre) If you're working 7hrs or less you only get 20mins break (you have to work 8hrs or more for 1hr lunch and 20min break) Constantly understaffed (I wonder why...) resulting in you being given tasks that usually multiple people are doing.

As many others I started really motivated but soon all your passion is killed So many people from spanish background speaking in their language makes you feel uncomfortable (in the same time even some of the managers don’t speek proper English (I’m not English as well)) Didn’t recieve a proper training In general nobody Cares about you..fully unprofessional.. Sometimes they change the rota and if you are not there nobody calls you PAYMENTYou can’t relay on your payments as they got mistakes and if there is something wrong you need to go to the store manager(if they have time at all) and let them know but all you will get is”I will check and I will get back to you”and it never happens so basically your payment is what it is and nobody gives a .. Managers don’t have time being always “busy”,losing your holiday requests,can’t remember you and mistake you for someone else Feels like you are surrounded by snakes..some colleagues are super hypocritical,you feel pressured all the time They forced me to take holiday and they allocated me without even telling me (so the branch can “stay in the budget” You need to deal with some super rude customers on a daily basis so after a while your desire to deliver exceptional customer service is being killed Guys before I started I’ve read a lot of reviews but lead by my hopes I started and now I can sayeverything was true! So trust the reviews and don’t waste your time If you are good at your job after a while they need you all the time cause they don’t have staff so you need to go for early openings and late closingseven managers quit because it really takes the life out of you... Very demanding job Some Managers are just chaotic and don’t know what they are doing I guess if you are outside of London the payment will be ridiculous cause it will be like 7,07 an hour in London it’s 8,08(with the london living wage)+comission When you start (especially after 15th of the month) you need to wait till 28th of the next month for your first payment..So I waited a month and a half for my first check and of course it was mistaken.. I wanted to request to be transferred to another branch but after three attempts to speak to the head manager (cause whe was always busy) I gave up ,it’s a company which doesn’t care for it’s people so after I stressed myself so much with them I decided that I would rather leave Since the first day to my last day you always feel unwelcomed..for instancein th beginning they don’t give you a locker although they say they will so you need to ask yourself for everything.. in the end all you get is a “bye” As I’ve read in one of the reviewsseeing someone crying is usual.. and it really is.."

All staff are given a uniform which is very handy (particularly as the men's uniform was a suit!),The wage was basic (but I suppose that is unsurprising).

Be prepared for serious hard work. At Zara it's all about putting the product out in the shop floor, costumer service is not a priority AT ALL!  Managers shouting on the radio all the time, asking you to do the impossible. Always pushing you and pushing you until you can't take it anymore.  ""Running"" is the most common word in Zara stores, product must be available for customers to grab it and you have to run hundreds of items at the same time. Sometimes during your entire shift. Good luck if your in a big store where the shop floor area is huge, you'll end up doing a marathon by the end of the day.  20min break. So... nothing. I'd have to run if I wanted to eat and do something else.  Managers change the rota from one day to the other without even letting you know. A college was off on Monday and Tuesday, they changed the rota and she had to work on Tuesday and they didn't let her know. She didn't show up on Tuesday (had no way of knowing) and managers told her off.  If you work 7 hours, they only give you 20min break and not a full lunch hour.  overtime, overtime, overtime. Closing take hours and you never leave on time. Every closing. You get paid but you end up working until late.  Blame culture like I've never seen before. The store manager blames the department manager/floor managers, who blames the sales assistants. You're fine, as long as you have someone else to blame.  You get a funny look from managers if you put too much effort on costumer service.  No respect for personal life.  Salary is quite low.  Hard to communicate with colleagues that barely speak English, as in not knowing what ""hat"" means.  I'd go crazy if I didn't leave the company. Not good for your health, mental and physical. ******* I understand that this does not apply to every Zara store, but I do know it happened in mine on a daily basis."

""Staff discount of 15%"" (which, by the way, I actually never received. And is also less than VAT...)  The occasional, nice manager who will thank you for your work.  Commission depending on your overtime and if the store's targets are hit."," Too much overtime. Was told during training that they understand you have lives outside of work, but no, they don't. Overtime is mandatory and they are not understanding when you try to change shifts or have other commitments.  The requirement of having to be 10 minutes for every shift and not being paid for the extra 10 minutes. If you are late to the meeting, you get told off, but if managers are late, it's fine.  It's fine for sales assistants to chat with each other, but as soon as a cashier finishes the queue and tries to talk to another cashier, we are told off by the manager for standing around doing nothing, and not helping with the rest of the team.  If the manager above you doesn't like you, then you are out of luck. Anything you do is not good enough. You can be extremely friendly and polite to customers, and customers will be nice back, yet the manager will still have a go at you for having terrible customer service.  If you do well, and put in a lot of effort, it is not recognised. There is no encouragement or motivation. If you do something wrong, there is only criticism.  The pay is not that great for what is expected of you. There's commission, but then things such as the Zara shopping bags are bought for... using your commission.  You are contracted to work in a specific department, but sometimes they shift you to other departments when there's not enough staff. Worked in another department and a manager grabbed me by the arm and dragged me backwards with force to a coat that I had used the wrong hanger for to hang up. Very unprofessional."

1,"Former Employee, more than 1 year",The absolutely worst two years of my life,21-May-18, Cashier,"London, England"," you get to meet a lot of lovely and friendly people  staff discount for all Inditex companies if you are a student they will try to accommodate your schedule, beacuse of the 'Student Friendly company' they are. However it will be done with a fake smile and rather rude comments, whenever you will need any kind of favour with a day off or shift swap  don't even count on it you're already on a black list.","I was working parttime in Zara during my University. It was an absolutely horrendous and very upsetting experience. I would never recommend it to any of my friends. The management is ruthless and lacks the basic sense of humanity. There's a lot of cons that I could mention however the main are:  the lack of flexibility management does not respect you I experienced and saw it so many times  managers yell at you in front of the customers, not willing to help you out, boosting their ego on your failure or they simply take out all their anger or frustration on you, why? just because they can.  HR  totally uselless. Usually will not take your side. Takes ages for them to act on any issue, not to mention they do mistakes when it comes to counting up the montly hours and shifts at the end of each month, no harm but you don't get paid if they make a mistake. They don't understand the concept of 'confidentiality' policy  a lot of people shop in Zara, and yes the policy changes once in a while. However management changes it however they want and whenever it's convenient for them. I witnessed one of the managers refunding his husband's worn coat without proof of purchase and right credit card, just because he could do it closing shifts  usually two people on a closing shift duty  you have to basically do everything that was not managed to be done during the day. Did I mention taking out rubbish ? Yes, if you are the chosen one ( usually one of the cashiers either from a department with more cashiers or just the person who is not liked) have to go to the toilets on a top floor and take out all rubish bags that were changed and left by cleaninig team during the day, all boxes left after morning's delivery, sort them out and transport it down by lift on YOUR OWN. It's rather disgusting and dirty job to do, the plastic bags are leaking or have a holes in them. You usually stay extra 1520 min if no one wants to help you  no one usually does  everyone wants to get home asap. facilities management don't care is lift does not work. The store I used to work in had the stockroom on the top floor which meant if there was stock delivery that was usually roughtly 2030 heavy boxes per day it had to be transported by lift upstaris before the opening time. However, the lift was out of service for around one month and all those boxes and rails with clothes must have been transported by employees climbing 4 floors up and down the stairs. Management did not even help with the boxes  they were just rushing everybody 'cause it's opening time'.  sick  I saw so many people being bullied by their managers to come to work when they didn't feel well. It was disgusting  still they do it, why ? Because there's no one to cover the shop floor. If you have more than 3 (!) sick days in 6 months you get a disciplinary hearing where another manager bullies you for 2 hours straight, assuming you are lying and trying to prove it  I had a situation when one of the managers was Googling the medicines I was perscribed by GP in front of me to prove that I'm lying."

1,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",Sales Assistant at Zara Oxford Street,13-Jun-17, Sales Assistant,"London, England","As a part time position the money is ok. However, I would not recommend for a full time position as I do not believe the money is enough to sustain yourself. The schedule was ok, mostly in the afternoons and evenings which allowed me to study as well. However, due to the fact that that it was so busy and that we were almost always required to work over time, it was physically and mentally exhausting, therefore making it very difficult to balance working with studying. The managers were always very pleasant, encouraging and helpful. They always to took the time to speak to me and answer any of my questions.","The worst part however are the coworkers. They are extremely rude, inconsiderate and manipulative. I have been given a brief introduction of my duties however nobody bothered to answer my questions along the way, despite the fact that they were always castigating me to ask for help more often. The staff did not posses a good command of the English language and it was very hard for me to maintain communication with them. In addition to this, I have noticed that they liked to put other people down and often publicly humiliate them in order to perhaps feel that they are better in a way (I mean a bunch of sales assistants a started laughing at me within my earshot because I did not fold some jeans ""their way"", when nobody has ever told me how they want me to do it exactly) . Keep in mind that this was coming from other sales assistants, and not from the managers who understandably did not have the time or any incentive to engage in such petty acts. Overall, I left like I had been bullied, ignored and often talked about behind my back for no good reason other than the entertainment of the other sales assistants. The girls especially seemed to be very unfriendly towards me (as a girl) from the start, very catty and very deceitful. Also, and this is a big point, as most of them were from Spain they were always speaking in Spanish during work and if you were not speaking their language more often than not they simply could not be bothered to speak with you, to help you or to engage with you in any way. I would not recommend to anyone unless you are willing to tolerate / engage with such behaviour."
1,"Former Employee, less than 1 year",The most AWFUL place to work,05-Nov-19, Sales Assistant,"Sheffield, England",Paid more than minimum wage. Could use the 25% discount across all Inditex brands,"The store is absolute CHAOS, but for no reason? I have never seen any other clothing store in as much chaos or in as much of a mess as Zara is on any normal day, even when other shops are busier. The folded clothes on tables really add to the MESS. Other members of staff aren't particularly friendly and the management treat you like rubbish. There is no praise in any shape of form or any acknowledgement for doing anything well, the only communication there is is negative with management telling you off over the radio so every other employee can hear (very unprofessional). You tend to be doing the same thing all shift, which gets very repetitive and it means you'll be stressed out the whole shift if you know its busy in store (which it always is). New starters are always shoved into the fitting rooms, which is one of the most stressful jobs. You are told by management to ask for help if you need it, but then when you ask they refuse to help you and tell you off for being too slow. But then when you don't ask they come over and check they ask you why you didn't ask for help? Makes sense doesn't it :) Overall, too much is expected from you, and you are treated so badly. Why work for Zara when you could work for a different clothing brand with better perks, better staff and better management? Breaks are only 20 minutes if you work for 6 hours and the staff room is so small that there is nowhere to sit and if the room is full its so intimidating to even go in there. On my first shift I was told that working at Zara was all about speed rather than providing a good customer service. This is 100% true. You were forced to give bad customer service because how management would treat you for not doing what they told you to do fast enough, even though the role of a sales assistant should be to provide a great customer service. This was impossible to do, which adds to the stereotype of Zara employees being the rudest people. I genuinely dreaded every single shift, so please take my advice and don't work here."

(but that is not the case everywhere) Training was very helpful. You learn about everything in the store.,"Notice how there are more cons than pros. Rota: There is no way to have a life because you are constantly on the look out to see if your time is being changed EVERYDAY. For example if a person is wanting to work for 20 hours they will have to work 4 hours of 5 days out of the week. and the times can range from 91, 15, 37. No week is the same. You cannot work parttime and expect it to be condensed to two and a half days. It will never happen because there are not enough people to cover everyone's shift. But despite that reason, it won't happen because it allows the company to tax avoid if they give people short hours to work during the day because it is a daily commission. TIME:You do not get paid if you work 15 minutes before hand because you are assigned an allocated time. And you also get a warning if you are more than 2 minutes late for your shift. Yet it's ironic you do not get payed extra for the 15 minutes you work before hand. You have to be aware especially when signing in your hours, if you don't sign the end of day sheet then you do not get paid for that day. Many times I had to ask to get the sheet printed to make sure of payment. Even then it is still not guaranteed that you will get paid correctly as I had to speak with the manager to ensure my hours were correct and unsurprisingly they were not. Manager was very rude and assumed I was lying about my own hours. You check a commission sheet that is printed on the board every week to see if hours are correct. It feels really disorganised and messy to see that a piece of paper hung on a board is the sheet that is the confirmation to your hours. This isn't to do with Zara personally(it could happen in other retail places), but you need to have a high tolerance level of customers. Customers are disrespectful to the store, dumping clothes on the floor and being incredibly rude to staff. The pay to top it off is not good for how much people tolerate and are expected to do. I hope you take into consideration and do not experience what I went through whilst working at Zara. The stars left blank were not personal to me to have an opinion."
